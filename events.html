            The Chorus Concerts and activities are made possible as 
            a result of donations, contributions and support from its
             audience, members, local businesses, music lovers, and 
             the community. <br><br>
             If you are a music lover and want to be a part of this great
             project of creating the greatest choral community in Africa, this 
             is an opportunity to be a part of the next level of choral music. <br><br>
             The Chorus, a non-profit organization, relies on the generous 
             contributions of its supporters in order to continue enriching 
             our community with great music. <br><br>
             Donations realized by the chorus goes into the production of our 
             concerts. They take care of:
        </p>

            will like to work with you. All you have to do is fill our 
            sponsorship form by clicking the link below. We look forward to

            Perks of being a sponsor
        </h2>
            
        <p>
            We solicit for sponsorship because we need your help. We 
            need your help to enable us give back to the community by 
            making many of our concerts free to the public or at a 
            reduced rate. Just like we mentioned previously, these 
            contributions help us pay for our venues, help us organise 
            our set-up and sometimes our props, covers for our recordings,
            helps with our printing, and the list keeps going on and on. Our
            sponsors in return will gain exposure to our diverse audience. 
            Sponsors will be listed on our media handles, website and on our
            printed programs. Any amount given towards sponsorship will be 
            highly appreciated. <br><br>
